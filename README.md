# WobblySphere
This repository showcases an interactive 3D experiment built with Three.js, featuring a dynamically deforming “wobbly” sphere. The effect is achieved through custom shader programming (GLSL), where noise-based vertex displacement animates the sphere’s surface, creating an organic, fluid-like motion.
The scene uses an HDRI environment map for realistic reflections and includes a secondary 3D model (Suzanne, the Blender monkey head) to validate shading and lighting. Camera movement is controlled with OrbitControls, allowing for full exploration of the scene.
This project created with the guidance of the Three.js Journey course, which provided instruction on advanced WebGL and shader techniques.
